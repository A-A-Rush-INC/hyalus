- GUI need to be locked, so no scrolling outside of the chat
- Messages should be pushed up with the touch keyboard (mobile devices)
- Gestures to open and close sidebar (hamburger menu icon is weirdly placed and unintuitive)
- Click on channel to hide sidebar
- Extend GUI to top of iOS menu bar (to take advantage of black-translucent)
- Service worker page (or notification/in-page banner) for updates/offline
